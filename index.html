<article class="body"> From friendships to salary negotiations, 2020 can be the year
  you conquer work and your career. Taking hold of your future begins with
  stadning up for yourself, while also learning to navigate the complicated
  world of office politics. The murky friendships and bureaucracy can at times
  be maddening, but persevering dose not only mean climbing the corporate ladder.
  it could also mean defining your own path. </p>

    <h2>Find more happiness at work</h2>
    <article class="body"> As many as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/guides/year-of-living-better/how-to-create-a-better-work-environment">
      third of United States workers</a> say they don't feel engaged at work.
      The reasons vary widely,and everyone's relationship with work is unique.
      But there are small ways to improve any job,and those incremental improvements can add up to
      major increases in job satisfaction.</p><p> In fact, one study found that changing even just a small portion of what
      makes up your job can have a major impact on your overall happiness. In
      other words: You don’t need to change everything about your job to see
      substantial benefits. A few changes here and there can be all you need.<a class="read-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/smarter-living/how-to-be-happier-at-work.html">Read more</a></p>

    <section id="strengths">

        <h2>Use your strengths more wisely</h2>
        <article class="body"> In the past two decades, a movement to
        play to our strengths has gained momentum in the world of work. It’s a
        travesty that many people are fixated solely on repairing their
        weaknesses and don’t have the chance to do what they do best every day.
        But it’s a problem that many people aren’t thoughtful about when
        to do what they do best.<a class="read-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/smarter-living/how-your-strengths-can-make-you-weaker.html">Read more</a></p>

        <section id="failure">

          <h2>Track-and learn from-your failure</h2>
          <article class="body"> When things go right, we’re generally
          pretty good at identifying why they went right-that is, if we even
          take time to analyze the success at all. Preparation, proper scheduling,
          smart delegation and so on. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. But falling
          on our face gives us the rare opportunity to find and address the
          things that went wrong (or, even more broadly, the traits or habits
          that led us to fail), and it’s an opportunity we should welcome.<a class="read-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html">Read more</a></p>

          <section id="drama">
            <h2>Avoid drama</h2>
            <article class="body"> Gossip at work is common, as is the
              desire to be a part of a group. In a new work environment,
              this combination can be harmful if you fall in with colleagues
              who are<a href="https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-next-time-you-want-to-complain-at-work-do-this-instead"> known for being negative and wasting productive time.</a>.
              While complaining with co-workers can turn some of
              these colleagues into friends, <a href="http://www.jilljacinto.com" target="_blank"></a> Jill Jacinto, a millennial
              career expert, said it’s best to avoid gossip altogether.
              “If someone asks, ‘What do you think of Mark? Have you worked
              with him yet?’ just focus on the professional,” she said. “‘He’s
              great to work with. He seems to know technology really well.’”<a class="read-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/smarter-living/how-to-answer-tricky-personal-questions-at-a-new-job.html">Read more</a></p>

            <section id="yourself">

                <h2> Ask yourself: Are you doing what you want to be doing?</h2>
                <article class="body"> Maybe you are! Or maybe you’re not??
                  Who knows! It’s one of the toughest questions we’ll grapple
                  with in our lives. But when was the last time you were
                  completely honest with yourself and thought about it?
                  If you’re like most people, probably not recently. “I’m a big
                  believer in evaluating where you think you are in your
                  life about once a year,” said Art Markman, professor of psychology
                  and marketing at the University of Texas at Austin, and
                  author of the book <a class="read-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/01/smarter-living/thinking-about-a-job-or-career-change-read-this.html"target="_blank"> Read more</a></p>“Bring Your Brain to Work.”</a>
                   He added: “Don’t wait for a tragedy to strike before you’re willing to
                  actually think about this.”<a class="read-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/01/smarter-living/thinking-about-a-job-or-career-change-read-this.html">Read more</a></p>

                    <h2> Learn to deal with jerks (without being one)</h2>
                    <article class="body"> At some point in your work life,
                    you’ve probably had to interact with a jerk. They’re the
                    people who demean and disrespect you. They might steal
                    credit for your successes, blame you for their failures,
                    invade your privacy or break their promises, or bad-mouth you,
                    scream at you and belittle you. As the organizational
                    psychologist Bob Sutton<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Asshole-Survival-Guide-People-Treat/dp/1328695913" target="_blank"> puts it</a>, they treat you like dirt,
                    and either they don’t know it or they don’t care. <a class="read-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/smarter-living/how-to-deal-with-a-jerk-without-being-a-jerk.html">Read more</a></p>

                      <article class="body"> It’s a request that experienced
                      people of any industry have gotten at some point: “Can I
                      buy you coffee and pick your brain?” While well-intentioned,
                      execution is everything, and sometimes these
                      unsolicited requests for a casual, nformational interviews can
                      come off as entitled and presumptuous. And for the receiver,
                      it can be difficult or even unrealistic for a busy
                      professional to coordinate bespoke consultation appointments
                       for everyone who asks.  <a class="read-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/smarter-living/the-right-way-to-ask-can-i-pick-your-brain.html">Read more</a></p>

                      What if people think we’re awkward or have a bad handshake?
                      What if we’re evaluated poorly compared to others? With all
